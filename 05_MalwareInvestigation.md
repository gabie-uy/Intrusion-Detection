# Malware Investigation

- Malware is a type of software attack that can disrupt a computer, server, or any device. There are many types of malwares. All types of malwares have something in common due to all of them developing from one another. These attacks can also cause unauthorized access to systems and devices, which significantly affects data and information privacy. One of the attacks discussed below is a combination of other malware attacks but specifically can force a victim to play music embedded through a YouTube link. This first attack is named SILENTTRINITY Powershell Stageless Stager. The next attack presented is called an Orangeworm, affiliated with an attack called Exfiltration, where the attack hides through packages to avoid detection. Exfiltration helps create Orangeworm to be a much more brutal attack to find. Lastly, Backoff is another type of attack that is not as discrete as Orangeworm. It causes a high alert on threats due to bringing to the attention high numbers of connections per interval in a connection.

- As a SOC analyst, it is best to study the company’s activities and actions in the network and systems. Studying will provide an idea of the everyday actions done by the company; therefore, it will be slightly easier to tell the difference between something suspicious and not due to the difference in activity. There will be patterns and addresses that will be different, as well as the time those actions are done. It does not mean that analyzing threats will be any easier because many attackers know how to act like regular users. They are capable of pretending to blend into the scenario. Experience and practice will help any analyst to discover threats as soon as possible, no matter how hidden they are. Like for Orangeworn, it is not easy to determine the threat unless the analysis is done thoroughly. Addresses found affected in the systems should be checked, especially if the attack is critical. There may be unauthorized access, disruption, or even stolen information that can be crucial to the company. Based on the figures below, the criticality level would most likely vary in the number of threats found. However, the threats found in the backoff threat are alarming, and best to check first ahead of the others. As an analyst, it is better to check the threat that will most likely affect the company more in the long term versus a threat that will affect the short term. These threats may affect the workflow and productivity of the company, causing system disruptions and possible shutdowns that will give customers negative experiences with the company—assuming that these systems and programs are first checked before being used in public. Customers trust these companies with their information and, therefore, should be protected. The trust built between the customer and the company can cause long-term effects significantly if a large number of customers are affected by the attack, and the company may lose its customers in the long run. Customers may feel unsatisfied and unbothered by a simple error in the short run. The business can lose very little in a short, temporary error. However, multiple short-term errors will eventually lead to long-term problems if accumulated.

- Like every malware or attack, companies should invest and be able to fight off attackers like a game of chess. Malware is very prevalent nowadays; at the same time, many prevailing software and systems help prevent these attacks. There are now many concepts and frameworks to understand to mitigate these attacks. Aside from the software, systems, and frameworks built to avoid significant damage, individuals should be able to allow themselves to be aware of such possibilities and the importance of protecting their data and devices from attackers.
